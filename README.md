# Self-Driving-Car-Simulation-using-Machione-Learning


Self Driving Cars are going to rule the roads in the recent future. These have been designed in order to in order to automate driving, prevent the number of accidents due
to human error and increase the comfort and safety level of the customers. Designing such cars requires the usage of several technologies like GPS, sensors, LIDAR,
Computer Vision and Machine Learning.

As a step towards knowing and understanding the various aspects involved in making such vehicles, I decided to pursue this project of “Self Driving Car Simulation using Machine 
Learning”.

In this project, I have implemented one of the most important part of driving a self-driving car by using machine learning model to predict the Steering angle of a car 
which depends upon the image inputs it gets through cameras mounted on the car. Since the car will also interact with the real world objects,
I decided to implement Convolutional Network models to predict the traffic sign and traffic lights which would help in navigation of the vehicle in real world. 
Also I implemented an algorithm using SVM classifier in order to detect and track the other vehicles around the self-driving car giving the car information about its surroundings.
